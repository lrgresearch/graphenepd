### Project Description

<img align="left" src="graphenepd-proje.png">

**Abstract**

In this study,  the effects of Pd-terminations and Pd-dopings on electronic, structural and optical properties of (5,5), (7,7), (9,9) and (11,11) type armchair graphene nanoribbons will be investigated using ab-initio approach.

### Objectives

Experimental growth of graphene started with the simple removal method (in small pieces) proposed by Novoselov et al., then the device fabrication was one step closer with successful (on a whole substrate but thick) graphene growth by sublimating Si from the SiC surface. In recent days, it has been observed that both large and thin graphene layers can be grown in magnifications on transition metals such as Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu) and Ruthenium (Ru), contrary to these two methods. Of these, Ru has been an interesting success and attention has turned to other similar transition metals. Palladium (Pd), on the other hand, draws attention to its possible interaction with graphene because it is relatively easy to obtain, high purity and similar physical properties compared to Ru.

In this study, we intend to examine how the Pd element affects the electronic and optical properties of graphene by using ab-initio computational methods for edge saturation and doping in graphene nanostrip structures.
